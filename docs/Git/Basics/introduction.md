# Introduction to Git

## What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work together on non-linear development histories.

## Why use Version Control?

- **History**: ability to revert files back to a previous state.
- **Collaboration**: multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.
- **Backup**: every copy of a Git repository is a full backup of all history.
- **Branching**: safely test new ideas in a separate area without breaking the main project.
