# PHP Introduction

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development.

## What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.

## Why Learn PHP?

- **Easy to Learn**: PHP has a simple and intuitive syntax

## PHP Features

## Your First PHP Script

Let's create a simple "Hello World" program:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

## PHP Syntax Basics

- PHP code is enclosed in `<?php` and `?>`
- Statements end with a semicolon (`;`)
- PHP is case-sensitive for variable names
- Comments use `//` for single-line or `/* */` for multi-line
